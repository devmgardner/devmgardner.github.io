    <title>Devin's Basic Webpage</title>
    <body>
        <h1>This is what my headings look like! I've chosen what I hope is a simple font and color scheme that is easy to read.</h1>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>This is the formatting I've chosen for paragraphs. I'm not the most creative person; I tend to like very basic layouts and color schemes.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I'm much more of a music person than I am a graphic artist; I used to draw, sketch, paint, and even sculpt. Nowadays I play any instrument I can get my hands on.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Anyway, this was really just to see how my borders various formatting choices would play out.</p>
